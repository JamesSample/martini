# Riverine chemistry for the MARTINI project

This repository contains code for exploring and processing water chemistry data for major rivers draining to Skagerrak. These datasets are required to support marine modelling undertaken as part of the MARTINI project.

The analysis presented here considered 39 rivers: 25 in Norway, 5 in Sweden and 9 in Denmark. A full list can be found [here]() (note that there are 42
