# Riverine water chemistry for the MARTINI project

This repository contains code for exploring and processing water chemistry data from the major rivers draining to Skagerrak. These datasets are required for marine modelling being undertaken as part of the MARTINI project.

 * **[Initial data exploration](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/martini/blob/master/notebooks/water_chem.ipynb)**. A notebook exploring available river chemistry datasets and various methods for standardising and resampling the raw data.
